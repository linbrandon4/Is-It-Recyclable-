I collaborated with Baron Lin and Samiel Azmein on this project that won us first place at HackGwinnett.

**Inspiration:**
Our inspiration for
Our inspiration for the project was that we ourselves were struggling with how to recycle. This is because if even one non-recyclable item contaminates a bag with recyclable items the entire bag goes into the landfill, which unnecessarily contributes to the crisis of global warming.

**What it does:**
The program determines the recyclability of an object and what material it is made out of (eg: paper, glass, metal, plastic).

**How we built it:**
We used Google Colab and Jupyter Notebook to program a convolutional neural network in Python using a database of 50,000 images.

**Challenges we ran into:**
We had to keep switching our image datasets as either the folders for the data could not upload locally into the Google Colab file or it took too long to upload images onto the Google Drive.

**Accomplishments that we're proud of:**
We created a heatmap and 2x2 confusion matrix visualizing the results of our model.

**What we learned:**
We learned that with teamwork and dedication, anything can be done even with the time constraint given.

**What's next for Is It Recyclable?:**
We will integrate this program into either an app or a recycling bin directly to automate the recycling process and standardize this model.
